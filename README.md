# DAOsign Ink! Proofs Smart Contracts

## Overview
DAOsign is a decentralized platform for agreements with publicly verifiable and authorized cryptographic proofs-of-signature designed for DAOs. For a more in-depth overview of DAOsign proofs, you can refer to [this document](./docs/DAOsign%20Proofs%20Technical%20Design.pdf).

This repository contains two smart contracts:
- <a href="./contracts/daosign_app/" target="_blank">DAOsign App</a>
- <a href="./contracts/daosign_eip712/" target="_blank">DAOsign EIP712</a>

### DAOsign EIP712
DAOsign EIP712 is a helper contract used by the DAOsign App contract, facilitating the verification of EIP-712 signatures tailored specifically to the DAOsign App contract.

### DAOsign App
Meanwhile, the DAOsign App contract is the primary DAOsign smart contract that stores all proofs: Proof-of-Authority, Proof-of-Signature, and Proof-of-Agreement. This contract also allows users to validate DAOsign-generated proofs.

## How to Use These Contracts for DAOsign Proofs Verification
To validate a DAOsign-generated proof, follow these steps:

### Ensure that the proof was stored on Polkadot
If an agreement creator has chosen to store agreement proofs on another chain or only in IPFS, you can validate only Proof-of-Authority. This is because Proof-of-Signature and Proof-of-Agreement have links to Proof-of-Authority, so it must be stored in the smart contract to validate them.

### Open a deployed DAOsign App in a block explorer and locate the desired `validate` function
There are three validate functions (one for each proof): `validate_signed_proof_of_authority`, `validate_signed_proof_of_signature`, and `validate_signed_proof_of_agreement`.

### Call the desired validate function with signed proof data as a function parameter
The output of this function will be either `true` - the proof is valid, or `false` - the proof is invalid. If you have an invalid proof, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/DAOsign/polkadot-smart-contracts/issues) and our team will do our best to solve the problem.

## Prerequisites

To get started with the project, you should first follow a few steps. After cloning this repository, open your Terminal and navigate to the project root. From there, run the following commands one by one.

### Install Dependencies
```
npm i
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```

## Testing

DAOsign features three ways of ensuring contract quality:

- Unit tests for every smart contract
- Integration tests to be run both locally and with a dedicated Docker file
- Manual review of the code

### Unit Tests

Just run `cargo test -- --nocapture`. The expected output of the unit tests is the following:
```

### Integration Tests

To use integration tests not only for Ink! but for other languages as well, we have decided to use Typescript for this purpose. The framework that allowed that is Swanky Suite about which you can read more [here](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/wasm/swanky-suite/cli).

For the convenience of the end-user, we have provided two ways to run integration tests: with Docker or locally. A more detailed description of how to do that please see below.

### With Docker
Running tests with Docker is easy but to do that you want to make sure you have Docker installed on your computer, and it's running.

To run integration tests with Docker, you should follow 3 easy steps.

1. Firstly, you have to build the Docker image. To do that, in the root folder of the project, open a Terminal and run `docker build -t daosign-proofs .`
2. Secondly, run the image that will contain the project with all environment set up for you. Just run `docker run -d -p 9944:9944 --name daosign-proofs daosign-proofs` in your Terminal.
3. Lastly, in the Terminal install `swanky-node` and run to execute integration tests:
```
docker exec -it -u root daosign-proofs npx swanky node install
docker exec -it daosign-proofs /usr/src/app/bin/swanky-node --rpc-cors=all
docker exec -it daosign-proofs npm run test
```

The expected output should be the following:

```
DAOsignApp Tests
    Lifecycle
      ‚úî #1 (107ms)


  1 passing (565ms)
```

### Locally
What can be run with Docker can also be replicated locally. To run integration tests locally you should:

1. To start with, you should install a local node binary file by running in the Terminal from the root of the project `npm run node:install`.
2. Then, from the root directory start a local node with `npm run node:start` command. This should start a local Polkadot node that may look like the following:

```
3. Lastly, to run integration tests, open a new tab in your Terminal (make sure you're still in the root directory of the project), and simply run the `npm test` command. The output you should see is the same of the running tests in Docker.
